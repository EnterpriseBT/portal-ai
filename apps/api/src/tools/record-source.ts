/**
 * Record source — consumption-aware delivery of a tool's dataset (#121
 * child C, discovery D3).
 *
 * Generalizes #114's `resolveComputeRecords`: given an input (a `queryHandle`
 * or inline `rows`) and the tool's declared `consumption` contract, deliver
 * the records via the cheapest mechanism the data's N requires, bounded
 * above by the contract.
 *
 * `consumption` is a CEILING, not a mandate (spec key decision 2): for any
 * mode, N within the bound is delivered in-memory with zero overhead — so a
 * `streaming` / `engine-pushdown` tool still runs inline on small data. Only
 * when N exceeds the bound does the mode matter:
 *   - `bounded`         → apply the declared `onOverflow`.
 *   - `streaming` / `engine-pushdown` → stream over a cursor.
 *
 * The cursor (the unbounded > HANDLE_ROW_CAP tier) and engine-side
 * representative sampling ship in #129 (child D). Until then, over-bound
 * delivery that needs the cursor surfaces a clear COMPUTE_INPUT_TOO_LARGE
 * pointing at the streaming work. The in-memory tier (inline rows, ≤ cap
 * handle snapshots, and in-memory sampling of inline rows) lands here.
